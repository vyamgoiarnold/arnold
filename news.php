            <p>
                Tanzania’s Young Africans, affectionately referred to as Yanga by all and sundry, are basking in the light of glory, becoming the first Tanzanian team to play in the final of the TotalEnergies CAF Confederation Cup.<br>
                
                They are only the second Tanzanian team, after their arch rivals Simba SC in 1993’s CAF Cup, to play a continental final, and now, they are seeking to go all the way and reach the stars, to clinch their first ever continental title.<br>
                
                Wanajangwani dropped to the Confederation Cup after elimination in the TotalEnergies CAF Champions League. They were beaten 2-1 on aggregate by Sudan’s Al Hilal in the second round, and they have used that exit pain as fuel to charge their run in the Confederation Cup.<br>
                
                They played in the additional preliminary round, beating Tunisia’s Club African 1-0 in aggregate. They played to a barren draw at home, before winning the return fixture to earn their place in the group stages.<br>
                
                They were drawn in Group D where they finished top with 13 points, edging out Tunisia’s US Monastir on goal difference. They had four wins from six matches, a draw and a loss. Their only defeat was a 2-0 result away to Monastir while their draw was a 1-1 result away to Real de Bamako.<br>
                
                They beat giants and two-time champions TP Mazembe home and away, Monastir and Bamako both in Dar es Salaam.<br>
                
                In the quarters, they beat Nigeria’s Rivers United 2-0 on aggregate, the victory away from home in the first leg sufficing after a 0-0 draw in the return fixture in Dar.<br>

            <h3>Health and Culture</h3>
            <p>The ideas people have about health, the languages they use, the health literacy skills they have, and the contexts in which they communicate about health reflect their cultures. Your organization can become more health literate and increase its communication effectiveness when your staff recognizes and bridges cultural differences that may contribute to miscommunication.</p>
